## koa-scaffold

Sexy Koa in smart MVC environment

### Installation
````
$ npm install https://github.com/unicorn-it/koa-scaffold/archive/<CURRENT_VERSION>.tar.gz
````
E.g.:
````
$ npm install https://github.com/unicorn-it/koa-scaffold/archive/0.0.9.tar.gz
````

### Quick start

We are using koa-scaffold in many projects by our self. It helps you to build MVC web application with powerful koa.js and known MVC patterns in seconds. 

````javascript
// require Server class
var Server = require('koa-scaffold');
var your_router = require('./app/router');

// create app instance and chain all stuff together,
// as you can see, koa-scaffold injects models and ctrlers into
// app instance, it is a convenience way to organize all resource and modules
// which almost every route needs.
new Server({
  name: 'My very first App',
  database: {
    name: 'example'
  }
})
// A router will be a vera readable object which leads URLs to handlers
// they can look like:
// {
//   get: {
//     "":                  my_controller.main,
//     "list":              my_controller.list
//   }
// }
// Placing router.js in app folder helps readability
.route('', your_router)
// start the app
.run();
````

### Configs

all config params list below:
````javascript
{
  // site name
  name : "site name",
}
````

### Security

We added basic authentication too. For now only one user and pw can be passed.
To use this feature just call ```secure( opts )``` function.
```javascript
.secure({
    admin: {
        type: "basic",
            user: {
                name: 'default',
                pass: '0000'
            }
        })
    }
```
This will secure ```/admin``` url with http basic with username default and password 0000.

### Structure

```
/app
|-- assets
|-- controller
|-- helper
|-- model
|-- view
`-- router.js
```

### i18n

We are using i18n for internationalisation. 
To switch to a different, configured language, just append f.e. ?lang=en to the next url you are requesting.
If you do that, the cookie called "lang" will be added to the response and users will keep that language
until they call an url with ?lang=[another language] again.

To use a language, you need to have a .js - file in /locals that is named after the language like "en.js".
That file contains every translation identified by a id that you can call in f.e. template-engine like swig.

For Example in swig: 

template:
```html
<h1>{{ __('this.is.a.test') }}</h1>
```
locales-file:

en.js :
```javascript
    {
	    "this.is.a.test": "Your Headline"
    }
```
de.js :
```javascript
    {
	    "this.is.a.test": "Deine Ãœberschrift"
    }
```
